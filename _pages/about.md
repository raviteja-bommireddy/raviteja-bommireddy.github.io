# Hello, and welcome! 
I am a Undergraduate Student in the Artificial Intelligence department at Indian Institute of Information technology Kancheepuram `(IIITDM)`, focused on exploring research in Natural Language processing `(NLP)`, Large Langueg Models `(LLM's)`, Machine Learning `(ML)`.

My Research focus on grounding language models through retrieval, attribution, reasoning, while integrating multimedia elements to enrich the learning process. I am particularly interested in AI research that leverages knowledge-infused learning, to construct context that can be used effectively in generation, decision-making, and task-oriented agents for social good applications, improving societal impacts. 

Currently i am working as a Research assistant at [KAI2](https://kai2umbc.github.io/) lab. As my specific research intrests are still shaping up to a solid niche domain, would always open to discuss new exciting ideas to work colleberatively in areas like `NLP`, `LLM`, `VLM`, `ML` broadly AI which helps social good.
